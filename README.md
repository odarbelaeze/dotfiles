Getting a handle on this guys.

This config is managed using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

## Installing

### `zsh` module

First make sure you have the required software:

```bash
brew install stow antigen starship pyenv pyenv-virtualenv nvm neovim
```

Then edit the `./zsh/.zshrc` file and make sure that this block points to where
your `antigen` ended up being installed:

```bash
# Antigen plugin manager
[ -f /usr/share/zsh/share/antigen.zsh ] && source /usr/share/zsh/share/antigen.zsh
[ -f /usr/local/share/antigen/antigen.zsh ] && source /usr/local/share/antigen/antigen.zsh
[ -f /opt/homebrew/Cellar/antigen/2.2.3/share/antigen/antigen.zsh ] && source /opt/homebrew/Cellar/antigen/2.2.3/share/antigen/antigen.zsh
```

After that you can go ahead and install the module by:

```bash
stow zsh
```

For the best experience, make sure you get a nice terminal emulator like
[iterm2](https://iterm2.com/), or [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/).
Then, grab yourself a [nerd font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/#home) no make the
glyphs show correctly.
